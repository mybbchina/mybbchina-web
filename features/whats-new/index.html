After a problem with my board, Chris Boulton himself came onto my board and helped me fix my problem, and ensure it never happened again. Shortly after, he released a fix to make sure everyone using the board, had the fix. They fix every bug they find, and really put their heart into the project. That is why, I support and recommend, MyBB.&quot; &mdash; Louhabs</p><div class="sidebar_bottom"><div class="right"></div></div></div><!--FF_END_IGNORE--></div><div id="page"><div class="item"><h3>Full Feature Listing for MyBB 1.4</h3><h4>A list of all of the new and improved features we've built in</h4><ul><li>Completely redeveloped, rewritten and redesigned Administrator Control Panel</li><li>Moderator Control Panel allowing moderators to moderate & manage forum posts and announcements, users, bans and warnings</li><li>Completely redeveloped calendar functionality with support for multiple calendars, group based permissions, recurring and ranged events</li><li>More refined and user-friendly User Control Panel</li><li>Cleaned up forum listing and thread listing pages to reduce clutter</li><li>Login box at the top of every page, quickly accessible by clicking the "Login" link in the top menu</li><li>Built in warning system allowing forum staff to warn users for inappropriate actions with predefined warning types and percentage based warning levels allowing for account restrictions to be put in place</li><li>User group promotion system allowing users to automatically be promoted to a new user group based on their post count, registration date or reputation</li><li>Built in support for Search Engine Friendly URLs for forums, threads and member profiles for better SEO (Search Engine Optimization)</li><li>Support for multiple recipients in private messages, with the ability for certain members to be BBC'd on messages and the ability to "Reply to All"</li><li>User online status indicator (Online, Away, or Offline) in user profiles and for those that are online, their current location on the board</li><li>Rewritten search engine spider/bot detection system that's completely configurable by the control panel.
